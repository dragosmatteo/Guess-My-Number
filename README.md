# Guess-My-Number

This is my first application, I used basic concepts in Javascript, you have to enter a number and the code compares it with the number you need and you guess, if it's bigger it gives you a message and when it's smaller it's the same. I also put a score where it shows you how many attempts you managed to hit. When you guess the number, the background becomes green!
